qui concessas utilitates sumerent, sed malle se de virtute cum
optimis, quam de pecunia eum ditissimis certare. Proxime ad
hano laudem secedunt qui praedam modice deliberant, ut Pom·

portion was rather what was really meant by marrubioe, as Asconius
Pedianus.

4 But those persons ara more praised who, giving up their right,
took no part os the booty to themselves; like Fabricius, of whom 1
bars spoken, Wto ia lis loru of plory put oside war jort gaio, as Dio·
nysius says3 which hs said he did according to tho example ol Vale·
rius Publicola, and s few others. And these, M. Porcius Cato also
imitated in his Spanish rictum assortiug that nothing should come
to him trem the spoils of war, except what he had spent in meat
and drinkr adding however, that hs did not blame the generals who
had aocepted the advantuges usually granted; but that hs would rather
ooutend ior the prise ot' virtue with the best, than ior the preemi-
nenoe ln vealth with the richest. Nearsst to this praiso come those
who have taken to themselves a moderato share of the prise-troa-
surs; as Pompey in Lucan is praised by Cato, for haring given up
more than hs kept.

s In tha division, thero is sometimes account when oi those who
have been absent3 as Fabius Ambustus directed when Anxur was
uren. And sometimes for aomo special reason account is not taken
ol soma ol those who were present, as of the Miuutian army, by the
dietstoe Cincinnatus.
