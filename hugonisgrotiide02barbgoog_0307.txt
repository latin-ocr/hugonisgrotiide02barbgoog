1. 1 What we huwe hitherto said, pertains‚ for the most part, to
those who either have the supreme authority iu war, or hold public
offices. We must now consider what is lswful for private persons,
according respectiwely to Natural Low, DiwIne Low, and the Law of
Nations.

Cicero relatas that Oeto's son sarred in the ermy of Pompilius
till his legion was dismissed: that he then remained with the army
as a volunteer: and that Cato wrote to Pompilius, that if he wanted
to keep him in the army, he must make blm talne the military cath
agaim because tho former ceth being cancelled, he could not lsw·
fully ssght with the enemy. He adda also the very words of Cato’s
letter to his son, warning him not to take pert in the fighting. So
we read thet Chryses, a soldier of Cyrus, was praised, because, when
he had raised hle swerd to cut down an enemy, he lowercd it on
hearing the signal for a retreat. So Seneca.
