Car. XX] UBI DE PAOIS PAOTIONE, ETO. 333

num enim est credere id actum, ut belli semina evellerentur.

Idem quem modo laudavi Dionysius Halicarnassensis: oderisius.
α’πόχμη τοῦτομόνον ἡμᾶς σκοπεῖν ὅπως ἂν την παροῦσαν
ἔχθραν διαλυσαίμεθα πμδς ἀλλήλους, ἀλλ’ ὥστε μηδ’ αὖθίς

ποτε πολεμήσωμεν ἔτι dei παρασκευάσασθαι· οὑ γὰρ ἀνα-
βολὰς ποιησόμενοι τῶν κακῶν συνεληλύθαμεν, ἀλλ’ α’παλ-
λαγάςε μου tam cogitandum est de sarcienda ιἰι proesens
amicitia, quam id curandum ae bello iterum implicemur.-
nequc enim aa differenda sed ad auferenda mala conveni·

νιυοι quae postrema verbo tenus ferme desumta sunt ex
Isocrate, oratione de Pace. Pus-1⁶⁴0·

XX. Quse post perfectas pactiones capta sunt, reddenda
satis constat, sublatum enim jam erat belli jus.

XXl. At in pactionibus, quae sunt de reddendis his, quas arsat, v.
hello capta sunt, primurn latius interpretandae quae mutuas m*
sunt quam quac claudicant: deinde quae de hominihus agunt
plus favoris habent quam quoe de rebus: et inter eas quoe do
rebus, hae quae do agris plus quam quoe de rebus mobilibus:
et quse do his quae penes publicum sunt plus quam quse penos
privatos: et inter eas quae penes privatos, plus illes quse reddi
jubent lucrativo titulo possessa, quam oneroso, ut ques emtio-

nibus, quae dotibus tenentur. legg-geone·

placo, if there bo any words, or fair conjecture, to countcnance tho
suppositione: and this especially, if the right iu question ho not clear,
but controvertod. For it is gracious ιο suppose that to have been
dono, which plucks up tho soeds of παν. So Dionysius Halicarnassus,
whose concluding words ore nearly taken from Isocrates in his oration
on the Peace.

XX. What is taken after the tresty is made, is to be restoredr
for tho right of war was previously extinguished.

xx1. In agreements concerning the restitution of capturos mado
in war, in the first pisce, those articles are to be intorpretod more
widely, which are mutual, than those which aue one-sided3 in tho
next piace, those which treet concaming men aro ιο be when more
favourably than those concerning things3 and amongst those concern.
ing things, those concerning lsnds, more inwourahly than those con·
cerning moveables3 and those concaming things in public possession,
more favourably than those which sre in private, and among those
which are in private possession, those which direct tho restitution oi
things possessed by alucrstiwe title, more favourably thnn by an
onerous title; and those which hare been scquucd by purchase, more
favourably than those by donation.
