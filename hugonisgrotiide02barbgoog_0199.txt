vl. 1 Sed et, qui dammm ipse non dedit, aut sine
omni culpa dedit, sed rem bello injusto ceptam ab alio penes
se habet, tenetur eam reddere, quia cur alter ea curere debeat
nulla causa subest naturaliter juste, uon consensus ipsius, non
malum meritum, non compensatio. N on aliena ab hac re his·

nites, in Livy, give up what they had taken3 which, they say, mmcd
ccrsbythc right cf war.- sccmcdbecousethe warwasunjust, as the
Samnites hed confessed.

2 It is e cese cf the same kind, that su unequal commem, msde
without deceit, gives, by the Lew cf Notiora, a right of compelling the
fulfilment of the compacts; and yet hc who has the advantage, isbound
by the duty of an honest and picus man, to reduce it ιο equality.

VI. 1 But also, he who has not caused any damsge, or has
mused it without any fault, but who has in his possession a thing
talen in war from another, is bound ιο restore it, because there is no
causo, naturally just, why the other should be deprived of it3 nothis
cousent3 *not his ill desert3 not compensation. There is e story ιο
this effect in Valerius Maximus: When P. Claudius hcd ubere and
sold tlte pcoplc of Cancer-ico, although tlte money aud ahc conquest were
very decomptores, the Roman pecplc cougltt them cut and rcdmncd thece,
tecam ihc justice cs tle preceding did act mm clears and poce ιιοοι α
dwclliug in tho Aventino, aad restored their property. So, by a decree cf
the Romans, the Phocenses had their liberty and land restored. So
tho Liguriam who hod been sold by M. Popilius, were redeemed and
restored ιο liberty, and their property given back. So with regerd
to the Abderites, the Senste docreed the saum thing, adding the resson,
thst the war had been nujust.

2 But he who holds such property, if he have spent anythlng
upon it, may deduci ss much as it was worth ιο the owner ιο recorer
