ll. Est autem in horum promissis duplex inspectior nam
aut hoc quaeritur, an summam potestatem obligent, aut an se
ipsos. ‘Prior quaestio definienda estex eo, quod alibi diximus,
obligari nos et per eum quem voluntatis nostras ministrnm
elegerimus, sive voluntas illa specialiter expressa est, sire ex
ipsa praepositionis natura colligitur. Nam qui dat saeculia-
tem, dat quantum in se eat qua ad facultatem suut necessaria,

hy what we have said3 that we aro bound by his acts whom we hare
selected as the minister of our will, whether that will be specially
expressed, or be collected from the nature os the command committed
ιο him. For he who gives the means of acting, gives, as far as
depende on him, the means which are necessary to such action: which,
in moral matters, is to be understood in a moral manner. Thereforc
there aro two ways in which subordinate authorities bind the
supreme authority by their acts: either by doing that which, on pro·
bable grounds is conceived to be included in their office3 or beyond
that, committed ιο them by some special assignment of authority,
known to those whose interests are dealt with.

Ill, There are also other ways in which the supremo authority
is bound, in virtue of an antecedent act of its ministers, but so that
that net is not, properly speaking, the cause oi the obligation, but the
