[The note of Grotius respecting the οιιιι ιι which the rights οι
belligerante against neutrale had then been cniorccd ie ιο important,
tbatl will gire tho substance oi ιι below. Imayobserwe that the rules
which ιι has here laid down agree with tho Rules of internetional

Italian, and contains the constitutione oi ιιι Emperors οι Greece and Germany, the
lainga oi the Franks, οι Spain, Cyprus, the Balearic Isles, oi the Venetians, and οι ιιι
Genoese. ln Title 274 oi this boolr, controveraies οι ιιιι kind are treated; and the
sule giren is this, that iithe ships and the lading both belong ιο the enemy, the
matter is plain, and they become the property oi the captore. li ιιι ahip belong
to a neutral, the goods ιο an enemy, the belligerent may eompel the ahip to go into
ι port oi his own, paying the navigatura ior the ireight. Ii, on the other hand, it
is an anemy's ahip, with the goods oi a neutral, the ship is to be nnsomed, and it
the navigatore reiuse this, they may be tehen luto a port οι ιιι captore, and ιιι
captor must be prid ior the nse ol the ship.

In ιιι year 1438, when the Hollanders were at war with Labecia and ather
cities on the Baltic and the Elbo, they deeided in iuli Senate, that goods oi neutrale
found in the anemy's ships were not good prize, and that law was afterwards main·
tained. So also in 1597, the king of Denmarlr jndged, when he aeut an embasey to

goods into Spain, with which ιιι iiollandcrs were then in tieroe war. Τιι French
always permitted ιιιιιιιι ιιι right oi carrying on commerce with those who were
ιιι anemiea oi France3 and ao indiscreetly, that their enemies often covered their
goods with neutml names; as appears by an edict oi 1543, chap. 42, which was
copied again in an edict oi 1584, and the following year. In those edicte, lt is
plainly declared thet the friends of ιιι French shall be allowed to carry on com·
merce during war, prorided that they do ιι with their own ships and thelr own
men3 and that they moyland where they please, provided the goods are not muni·
