qni liber esee debuit. Hoc vero sicut latemur interdum locum
habere, its non ed omnia promissa predonibus facte pertinet:
nam utoni promissum quid est, ad liberandum promissorem
tenentur, opus est, ipse metu injusto causam promisso dederit³.
Si quis ergo ut amicum vinculis eximeret promiserit pretium,
tenebitur: hnic enim metus illatus non est, qui nd contrahen-
dum sponte venit.

V. Adde qnod et qui injusto metu coaetus promisit, te·
neri poterit, accedente jurisjurandi religione: nnm inde, ιιι
alibi diximus, homo non homini tantum, sed et Deo obstrin-
gitur, adversus quem metus exceptio non est. Verum tamen
est, ex tali vinculo solo promittentis heredem non teneri, quia
in heredem transeunt qnae in humano sunt commercio ex pri-
maeva dominii lege, ut in his non est jus illud Deo quaesitum
qua tale. lterum illud quoque ex superioribus repetendum
est, si quis fidem juratam aut injuratam praedoni datm violet,
enm eo nomine poenam apud alias gentes non debiturum: quia
odio praedonum placuit gentibus, quae adversus eos etiam ri-
tiose committuntur, dissimulare.

because he inflicted damage by injustice3 that is, by an act which is at
varianoe with the nature of human liberty, and with the nature of en
act which ought to be free. But though we allow that this may sorne-
timcs hold, it does not apply to all promises mede ιο robbers. For,
that he to whom n promise has been made, should be bound to liberate
tho premium, it is necessary that he should hare caused the promito
by unjust sear. 1f, then, any one hare promised e payment in order
to extricata e friend from captivity‚ he is bound by his promises for
he has not bcen put in sear, bnt comes and makes the contrect of his
own free will.

V. Add to this, that cren he who, under the influence of uujust
seer, has medo a promise, may be bound if the sanction of nn ooth be
added. For then, ns we hare elsewhere said, men is not bound ιο
man only, bnt to (ludelau, towards whom sear is not en exception. It
is however true, that, by such a bond of itself‚ the heir of the promissr
is not bound ; because what posses to tho heir is only what belongs ιο
human commem, from the primeva] law of ownership: and the right
which belongs to God, as such, is not included among such things.
And moreorer we must ugnin repent what we hnre said ebove3 that it
nny one violate his faith gison ιο n robber‚ either with or without an
cath, he is not on that account liable to punishment at the hands ot
