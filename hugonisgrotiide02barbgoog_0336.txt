2 De his tamen qum privatim sua sunt siquid pepigerit
rex etiam captivus valebit, ad exemplum eorum quae do pri-
vatis conventionibus dicemus. Quodsi exul sit rex, ἀ pacemne
facere poterit? sano, si constet eum non obnoxium viveres
ceteroqui parum a captivo sors ejus distabit: nam sunt et
laxae custodioe. Regulus sententiam in senatu dicere reeusa-
rit, dicens, quamdiu jurejurando hostium teneretur, non esse goffer
se senatorem.

intellect, cannot make peace. The samo is to be said of a king in
captivity, provided he received his sorereiguty from the pcople; for
it is not to be supposed that they would bestovv the power, to be
used by a person who was not free. Hence, in this caso, tho sove-
reignty, not indeed as to its whole rights, but as sar as exercise and
guardianship, will bo with tho pcople, or him to whom tho pcople
commite it.

2 Butes to things which belong to himself, if a king, cren in
eaptivity, make any compact‚ it will be valid, according to the example
of private conventione, of which vro havespolrcn. But if the king bc an
exile, can ho make peace? ch, if he is under no constraint ; other·
wise, his condition differs little from that of a captivo: ior the custody
osa captive is often lax. Regulus refused to deliver his opinion in

tho Sancte, saping that so long as he was under an oath to the
oneum, he was not a senator.

IV. In an aristocratical or democratical state, the right of mak-
ing treatios will be with the maJority‚ respectively, of the Council, aud
oi the hssembly of citizens who have a vote, as we have elsewhere
said. Thereiore conventione so made, bind them also who dissented.
