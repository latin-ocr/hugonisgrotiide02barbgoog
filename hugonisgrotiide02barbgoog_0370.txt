LVIII. Obiter boc addendum est, obsides interdum non

accessionem esse obligationis, sed resera partem principalem r

ut cum quis ex contractu sactum promittit non sunm, et quia,

eo non prestito, tenetur ad id quod intereat, ejus rice obsides

obligantur: quam fuisse videri seutentiam Caudinae sponsionis

diximus alibi. Non dura tantum, sed et iniqua est sententia yyy-¹¹³&

existimantium, obsides etiam sine consensu suo alterum ex fyb- flent ¹¹·
Iacto alterius posse obligari. ’

LIX. Pignora quaedam communia habent cum obsidibus,
quadam propria. Commune, quod et ex alio jam debito re-
tinentur, uisi obstet data fides: proprium, quod quae de iis
est pactio, non tam stricte sumitur, quam illa de obsidibus:
nequeenim aequale estodium. Res enim natea sunt, ut te-
neantur, non ct homines.

LX. Illud alibi quoque diximus, nullum tempus id effi· nattam·
cere posse, ne luitio sit pignoris, si id prestetur, pro quo pig-

habet, non creditur ex nova procedere. Ideo patientia debi-

LVIII. This however may be added in passIng: that sometimes
the hostages are not au accessory part of the obligation, but really a
prineIpal part; as when any one, by contrane, promises somethng to
bc done by another; and, that not belng performed is held to the
amount of interest iurolred in the agreement; then his bostsges are
bound ln hle place ; which was the doctrino held in the CaudIne con-
vestiemus wo have elsewhere stated. The opinion of those who hold
that hostages nro bound sor one another’s acts, eren without their own
consent, is hard and unjust.

LIX. Pledges hare some poluts In common with hostages, some,
peculias. It is common to the two, that belng gisen for one thIng,
they may be retained for another, except a stipulation to the contrary
hare been made. And it is peculias to Pledges, that the coronant
which is made concerning them, isnot to be taken so strictly as that
concornIng hostages: for thiugs are made, to be held as property;
men are not.

LX. We have also said elsewhere, that no perlod of tIme can
supersede the obligation of restoring the pledge, if that be done to
secure which the pledge was deposited. For an act which has an old
and known cause is not to be believed to come from a new one.
Therefore the forbearance of tho debtor [who deposited the pledge]
