Atque id populos voluisse credibile est, ne alioqui si ad id quod

esset cautio.

So Liry3 Dionysius; Appiam Pliny. And those who are ὶιοοιιᾱ by
the peace, also may share its advantages.

V. l hctus now consider what things may be the subiecta of
convention. The royal authority, or any part ef it, cannot be alienated
by convention by iringa, such as most kings now are, haring their
authority not as a patrimony‚ but us a life estate. Indeed before
they received the royal authority, at which time tho people was
superior to them, thore might hare boen a law made to render such
acts invalid in all future time, so that they should not produce any
obligation at all, eren for compensation for non-fultilment. And itis
to be believed that the people intended this3 since, if the action was
ralid to the contractor for compensator, the goods of the subjecta
might be taken for the debt of the king, and thus, the provision
against alienating tho royal authority might be defeated.

2 Therefore‚ that the whole royal authority may pass in a ralid
manner, it is necessary to haro the consent of the whole people;
which may be cliocted hythe representatires of different classes,
whom they call the Orders or tho Estatcs of the realm. 'ruat any
part of the empiro may be alienated, thero is need for a double
consent 3 both of the general body, and of that special part which is
under question ; since it cannot, without its own good-will,be separated
from the body of which it was a part. But tho part itsclf may
