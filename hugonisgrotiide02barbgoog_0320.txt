as Cicero rightly says. N ow among other rights, is this Right bestowed
by a Promise; therefore this right may be taken from him as a pe·
nalty, To this I answer, that the argument would hold, u the eon-
sention with him had been on the supposition os hle not being a cri-
minal. But when the treating with such a one has gone on with him
as being such a one, we must suppose that the treaty included the
remission of the penalty, so sar as this matter is concerned: became,
as we hare elsewhere said, we must suppose such an interpretation,
es provides against the whole act being null and reid. .

2 In Livy, Nabis well says, when Q.P1aminiusobjeots to him his
being a tyrant: th record ιο tbat mame, 1 cca emmer, that whatever

treaty war made.

IV. Again, it may be objected that, (aa we hare said aheady,) he
who, by means ef leur, caused the promise, is held to free the promisee,
