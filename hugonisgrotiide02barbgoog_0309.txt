sisset, causam reddidit: ὅτι βέλτιόν ἐστι ποῦ φονεύειν, πὸ
πείθεσθαι τῷ ἄρχοντι· qula proesectia parere satine aet
qaum hostem occidere. Et Plutarchus cur qui militia solutus

gefflgp est occidere hostem nou possit eausam reddit, quod legibus
militaribus non teneatur quibus teneri debeant pugnaturi. Et

ducis quam acam uoluntatem aequi.

3 at jus naturae et internum si respicimus, videtur in
bello justo cuilibet concessum ea facere, quae parti innocenti
intra justum bellandi modum profutura confidit: non etiam
res captas suas iacere, quia nihil ipsi debetur: nisi forte poa-
nam justam exigat mmmuni hominum jure.- Quod postremum

has leit the army cannot lawfully kill an enemy, that ho is not bouum
by that military law by which persons who engage in battle should
be bound. And Epictetus, in arrian, referring to the act of Chrysas
just mentioned, says, So memb betur did lte thiale it to do bia ‹iffiecr'a will

seems to be conceded, in a justwar, to any one, to do any thing, which

mamare: but not to make captured property his own, becauw there
is nothing owing him, exceptio tho case in rrhich hc is exacting a
just punishment by the common right of war. Which last, in what
manner it is restricted by the Gospel Lar, may be understood by
what has been already said.
