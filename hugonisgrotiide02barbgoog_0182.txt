(iar. 1x.] DE POSTLIMINIO. 175

extra id genus sunt, quod discrimen jam mox explicabimus,
ut illa videantur ahenata cum sua caum et sub conditiones

nata aut acceptilata suut.
Vll. At sicut ad postliminio redeuntem jura redeunt,
itaet jura in ipsum restituuntur, ac pro eo habentur, ut
Tryphoninus loquitur, ac si nunquam ille hostium potitus 1513 goffia
fuisset. '
VIII. Huic regula de liberis hominibus exceptionem
hauc recte asscrihit Paulus: postliminio carent qui aemilianensi
victi lwstibuu se iimmot, nimirum quia pactiones cum hos-
tibus factae valent jure gentium, ut alibi dicemus, neo adversus
aas eat postliminium. Ideo Romani illi a Poenis capti apud
Gellium: postliminium justum nori esee eibi, quoniam dejci tib-vii· ¹2
rio uincti foreat. Unde et induciarum tempore uon csse
postliminium recte a Paulo notatum est. At hos qui hostibus 3232 ¹· 1>-

from him? I speah of the property which he had in a neutral state.
Here, it seems, we must make a distinction between things which are
of such a nature that they return by postliminium, and things not of
that nature: which difference we shall soon explain. The former
class oi things are, it would seem, alienated with their cause, the per*
sou, and under condition: the latter are simply alienated. By alien·
atod,I mean giren away, or acknowledgcd as received.

VH. And as the person who returns by postliminium reeorors
his rights, so also rights against him are restored, and are held the
saum aa if he had never been iu the power of the enemy, aa Trypho-
mnus says.

VIII. Το this rule concerning free men, Paulus rightly annexed
this exception. These who sumender themselves, lose postliminium,
namely, because conventione made with an enemy are rulid by the law
of uatious, and against these, postliminium does not hold. So the
Romans captured by the tranguriensem, in Gellius, that they hare
uo right to postliminium, since they were captives by right. Whenee
during a truce, there is no postliminium,aa Paulus rightly notes ς but
those who are surrendered to the enemy without any eompact, return
by postliminium, as Modestinus gare his opinion.

a people; ao that they who hare been free, recorer their liberty, ifit
