142 DE tuna ACQUIRENDI BELLO OAPTA. [lain 111.

quem pars praedae dimidia cedebat lhis qui in procinctu inc-
rant. Sicci Alexandri miles praedam privatis ereptam suam
faciebat, nisi qnod eximia quaedam solitus esset ad regem
aurigema referre: unde accusatos cos uidemus qui ad Arbela conspi-
μ “” rasse dicebantur, ne praua omn ua stur enniana, ut nun
in aerarium deferrent.

4 At quse publica hostium aut regis inerant, exemta
erant huic licentiae. Ita legimns Macedonas, cum Darii castra
ad Pyramum amnem irrupissent, ingens auri argentique pon·
dns diripuisse, necquicquam reliquisse intactum qpraetor regis

tintin- tabernaculum: tradito more, inquit Curtius, act victorem victi
repis tabernaculo exciperent. Unde non abit mos Hebroe-
emesenorum, qui victi regis coronam regi imponebant pictori, eidem·
fledenae que assignabant (quod in Tbalmudicis Digestis legitur) regiam
supellectilem bello captam: et qnod in rebus gestis Caroli
Magni legimus, cum is Hungaros vicisset, priuatas opes mi-
liti, regias aerario cessisse. ht apud Graecos λάφυρα erant
publica, ut ante ostendimus, σκῦλα singulorum. Vocant autem
σκῦλα ea quae durante certamine eripiuntur hosti, λάφυρα

peopla, among whom half of the spoil urent to those who uere in
service in the army. Thus also tho soldicrs of Alexander hsd sor
their use the booty taken from privato persons, except that there uas
scustom of transferring to the king any object of peculiar raine;
snd accordingly, wc find that those who were said ιο have conspired
st Arbela, wore accused of intending to appropriato the whole of the
spoil, snd to giro nothing to tho trcnsury.

4 But what had been with the enemy, public property or king's
property, runs exempted from this licence. Thus we read that the
Macedonians, when thoy stormed the camp of Darius at the riser
Pyramus, plundercd a great mass of gold and siluer, and left nothing
nntouchcd except the king's tent: according ιο tlte established osope,
says Curtius, thot tta conquered party should nesius tlte conqsceror ia
tlte letny'e tent. And the usage of tho Hebrewa was not different, who
put the crown oi the conquered king on the head οι· the conqueror,
and assigned to him (as we read in the Talmudic Collections) tho
royal furnituro which uas taken in the war. So, in the history of
Chnrlemagne, uc read that when he had conquered the Hungarisns,
the private treasurc went ιο the acidiora, the royal, to the tressnry.
Among the Greeks there wore tuo different words for public and
private apoll, λάφυρα and σκῦλα. The latter implies what was taken
