AEmilio expugnatam aliis narravit, quanquam eo hostes decepti

promised assistance ιο his allies3 nor Flaccus, who related to others
that the enemy's city was taken; though the enemy was thus de-
ceived3 and Plutarch relatos a similar act of Agesilaus. For in
these cases nothing was said to the enemy: and the damage ιο them
which followed is extrinsic to our aet, and is in itself not unlawful to
be wished or procured. Το this head Chrysostom and others refer
the discourse of Paul, in which at Antioch he reprehended Peter as
