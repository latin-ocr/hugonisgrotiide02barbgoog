potestate: quia oppida pleraque et homines saepe in bello de·
dunt se sub conditionibus vitae salvae, aut et libertatis, ant et
bonorum, de quibus summae potestatis arbitrium exquiri res

Maharbal Romanis quibusdam, qui ex praelio ad Trasimenum
evaserant, satis longe absente Annibale, fidem dederat non

decllilllul In the some way, it is not the business of generals to gire up

men, conquesta, lands, obtained in war. By this rule, Syria was taken
from Tigranes, though Lucullus had giren it to him. Oi Sophonisba,
who had been taken prisoner in war, Scipio says that the jndgment
and decision oi the Sonate and People of Rome was to determine ; and
that therefore Masinissa, though the general hy whom sho was taken,
could not gire her liberty. That orer other things which are tahon

we have scen; not so much from the force oi their power, as from tho
customs of each pcople: on which subject we hare already spoken
sufficiently.

of things not yet acquired: because towns sometimes and men osten
surrendcr themselves in war, on condition of lires being spared‚ or
liberty, or property 3 among which concessione generally, tho state of
things does not allow the decision of the supreme authority to be
ashed. And byparity os reason, this right is also given to commandere
who are not the highest, within the limits of tho matters which are
committed to them to executa. Maharbal had given to some Romans
who had escaped from the battle st Trasimenum, Annibal being absent
