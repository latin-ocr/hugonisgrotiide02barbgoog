2 Interdum autern conditionatum pura subsequitur, quan·
quam id necesse non est, sed ex superabundanti. Hinc illa

nasa. formula: testor populum illam injustam esse, aeque jue

Latiaris, qaas ree aec calceant, aec dederam, aec fice-
runt, quas ree dari, fieri, colei oportuit, petro pioque

Romanam Quiritium feceram, deliquerant, qaod populea
Romanae Quiritium hellam cam Priscis Latia-is jussit esee.
Secutaeque Romanae Quiritium cenauit, casseu-sit, conscivit,
