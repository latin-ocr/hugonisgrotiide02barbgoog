nus obligantur, ne locupletiores fiant aliena yactura, id cst, ut

aut contractum praestent ex quo commodum solunt consequi,

ant de commodo discedant: de qua aequitat e titidem a nobis

alibi dictum est Et hactenus nec ultra recipi potest, quodn ιιι u ιο
dicitur velere, siquid utiliter gestum est Contra vero abn'
iujustitia excusari nan possunt, qui, cum pacta improbent,

ιοιιιοιι retinent quod erne pactis non haberent. ·ut cum senatus

Romanus, narrante Valerio, factum On Domitii neque prc- sup ι ..a

IV. 1 Illud quoque ex supra a nobis dictis repetendum 12¹& ιι Ἀ

tra mandata areana, intra limites tamen publicae funct tronis.

Hanc aequitatem recte secutus est praetor Romanus in insti-

toria actione: neque enim amne, quod cum institere geritur,

obligat eum, qui praeposuit, sed ita, si ejus rei gratia cui prte- Β Μ om

what was done, and allowed it to he dona; and in this case, if no οιιοιι
ιοοοοιι [besides consent] cau be probably assigned, we have elsowhere
stated what course the matter must take. The superior authority arc
obliged by the thing itsclf to this exteut3 that they aro not ιο ιο
mado better off by ιιο ιοοο of other porsons3 that is, that they aro
either to fultll the contract by which they wish to obtain au advantage,
or are ta give up the advantager a case of equity which we hara
elsewhere discussed. And so far, aad no further, acts which arc
performed so ns to bring utility tc us, are tabe said to be solid. On
the other hand, they οιιιιιιοι ιο excused from the charge of iujustiee,
who, while they condemn the compact, retain that which without ιιο
compact they would not hasa: as when the Roman sonate neither
could approre the act of Gn. Domitius, nor would rescind it: of which
kind of occurrence wo hare many in history.

IV. 1 Wa must also repeat what we have said before, that ha
who placed a person in a command, is bound, esen though tha person
so placed acts against secret orders; at least, within the limite af his
public sanction. This rule of equity was rightly followed by tha
Roman Praetor, in the action against aa Agcnt3 for it is not everything
donc by the Agant which obliges tha Principal, but such things only as
are contracted in the matter tor which his agoncy was employed ; but
he concerniug whom public natica was giren, that contracta with him
would not be held good hy the Principal, does not stand in the place
