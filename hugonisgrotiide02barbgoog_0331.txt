318 DE FIDE mnan HOSTES. [lan. III.

qnod promissum est epponi lite manente non poterit, ant aetio
de qua lis erat, aut litis damna et impensae, ita nee manente
bello compensari poterit antid ande ortum est bellum, aut
quidquid bellice gentium jure tieri solet N egotii enim natura,

ne nihil aetum sit, ostendit convenisse sepositis belli contro-
versiis: nam alioqui nulla esset pactio quae non posset eludis
neoforto male huc aptem quod tapud eundem, qnam jam lan·
davi aliquoties, Senecam est: Nullam excasationem recepe·
reat (majores) at homiues scireut fidem atique praestandam.
Satias araim erat a paucis etiam justam accusationem aea
accipi, quam ab omnibus aliquam tentari.

2 Qua ergo sunt qnae compensari enm ee quod promis-
sum est poterant? nimirum si qnid alter, quamvis ex alie
contractu, inter bellum inite, debet: si murnum dedit intra
induciarum tempora: pi legatos violavit, aut aliud quid iecit
quod inter hostes jus gentium damnat

3 Observandum tamen ut inter easdem personas fiat
compensatio, ae ne jus tertii cujusquam laedatur: ita tamen ut

between the two parties to alawsait‚ they cannot, during the eniteat
against what was promised, either the original ground of action, er
the loss and expense ef the euit; so while the war goes on, we cannot
bring into the balance, either the original ground οι the war, or any·
thing which has resulted from the exorciso of the usual belligerent
rights. For the nature of the business shews that the convention, in
order that it may not be without any effect, must have been made
setting aeide the controversias belonging ιο ιιο war itself. For other·
wise there could be no convention which might net be eluded. Το
this we may spply a passage of Seneca: [which however ie not very
closely to the purpose. W.]

2 What then are the matters, which maybe balanced againm that
which was promised? This for instnnee; if the ether, though irem
another eontract, made during the war, ewes us a debt3 or if ho have
committed damage duringa time ef truee; or is he have violated the
rights cf ambassaders; er done anything else which the an of Na-
tions condemns as between enemies.

3 But it is ιο ιο obserwed, that compensation must take place
between the same persons who are so bound ιο each other, and so
that the right ei a third party be net injuredy but still, so that the
goeds of suchets are understood to be bound lor what the state ewes,
aa we hare elsewhere said.

ι We must add this alsae that it is the part ef a genereus mind
