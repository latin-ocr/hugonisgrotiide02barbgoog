Crimen XXIV. Of Tacit faut.

1. lt is well said hyievolenus, that some things are agreed upon in
silence. This happens inpublic consentiens, andin private, andinmired.
The cause is this; that consent, however indicated end accepted, has
the force of transferring right. But there ere other signs of consent,
besides words and letters, ιι we hswe more than once indicated.

11. Some are by nature inherent in certain acts For an example,
take him who coming from the enemy, or from strangem, gives him·
aelf into the hands of another people or king. For thet such ι per.
son tacitly blnda himself not ιο (ιο anything against that stete in which
he scelos refuge, cannot bo doubted. Wherefore they are not to bc
followed, who say thet the act oi Zopyrus was free from blame: for
his fidolity to his iring does not excuse his perhdy towards those to
whom he flod. The same must be said of Sextus; the same oi Tar·
quin who went orer te Gabii. Virgil speaks cf Sinon's treachery und
crime.
