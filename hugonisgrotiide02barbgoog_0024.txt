001 0000 0010 to 101 10 history¹ anything on the subject es deter-
mined by instituted Law. When the 11001000 carried provisions to
1110 enemies 01 100 Carthaginisns, they were sometimes 101100 prisoners
by the Carthaginiens, and then given up by the Carthaginisus to the
Romans on being demanded. When Demetrius hold Attica with au
army, and had taken Eleusis and Rhamnus, neighbouring towns, in·

permit the subjecte 0100 enemy to traffio in their country, nor should assist the
enemy with soldiers, ships or provisions. And afterwards, in 1627, a convention
was made between the isings 01 Sweden and 01 1100100111, 10 the 011001 that the
Danes should prevent 011 eommeroe with the Dantsiciers, the enemies 01 1110
8110110ος and should not allow any merchsndize to pass the 800011, 10 1110 other
0000101011110 Swedes3 ior which terme the iring 01 1100100111 stipulated 101010
certain samagar 10 himself.

But these were special conventione, irom which nothing cao be interred whlolr
11 blndlng upon all. lior what the Germane said in their declaratione was, not
that all merchsndlse was prohibited by this consentino, but that only which was
once carried to Englend or made ln Englsnd. Nor were the Germane the only
party who refused 10 sohnowledge the doctrines 01 100 English, forbidding com.
100100 with their enemy. lior Poleud complaioed by her ambassador that the
Laws 01 Nations were intringod‚ when, 00 account 01 the English war with Spain,
they were deprived 01 100 power 01 trahiching with the Spanish3 as Csmden aud
Beidsn mention under the yeor 1697. And the Erench, alter the pesce 01 Verrius
wlth Spain, when Elisabeth 01 Eugland persisted in the war, being requested by
the English to allow their ships going to Spain to be visited, that they might not
privily carry munitione 01 war, would not permit this; sayiog that the request, 11
granted, would be mede s pretext 101 spoliation and disturbance 01 0001010100.

And in the leagne which the English mede with the ldollanders aud their ellies
10 the yesr 1626, a 0001001100 was indeed mode, that, other natione, whose interest
lt was that the power 01 Spain should 00 broken, should 00 requested to forbid
0001100100 with Spain; bnt 11 they would not agree 10 this, that their ships should
be searchcd, to 100 whether they carried munitions 01 1101; 001 1001 beyond this,
neither the ships nor the cnrgo should 00 detained, nor that any (1010000 should be
