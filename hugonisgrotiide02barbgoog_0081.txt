P XIV. Quod si jus etiam legationum violatum sit, non

so much tima is to be given as may conveniently suffice for doing what
is askcd.

XIV. But evon if the rights of legation be violated it does not
follow that a declaration of war is not needed for the effectu to
which 1 refer: but it is sufficient if it be mado in such way as it
may safely bo made, that is, by letter: as also it is usual to make
summonses aud denunciatione in unsafe places.
