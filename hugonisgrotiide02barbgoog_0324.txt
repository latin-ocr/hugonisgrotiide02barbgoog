appellabant, per quas ipse populus Romanus, ut Cicero pronae-uu
Balbo explieat, religione obligabatur. ’

2 Est ad hanc rem pertinens disputatio per se obscurior
apud Livium libro tertio, ubi ex sententia multorum juris in·
terpretum ait tribunos esse sacrosanctos, non etiam aediles,
judices, decemviros, quorum tamen si cui noceretur id nou
jure fieret. Causa discriminis est, quod reddes atque alii lege
sola defendebantur: quod autem postremum populus jussisset
id ratum erat, manente tamen lege nemini contra agere jus
erat: at tribunos religio publica populi Romani tuebatur: nam
jusjurandum intercesserat, quod ab his ipsis qui juraverant

sor the sake of public utility. For the state may give up what is
clearly its own, and the words may bo eo plain as to allow no excep-
tion. Valerius Maximus says to the Atheniens, Iicad tte Low to which
you ore bound oy ooth. The Romans called such lans loyes sacratae.-
and by euch, the Roman people itself, as Cicero for Balbus explains,
nae in conscience bound.

2 There isa somewhat obscure dissertation on this subjectio the
third Book of Livy, in which he says that, according to the opinion of
many jurists, the tribunes were soorosoact, but not the ediles, judges‚
decemvirs; though if herm was done to any of thern it was unlawsul.
The causeof the difference is, that the ediles end others were defended
by the law only3 and while the law lastcd, no one might act against
it3 but the tribunes were defended by the public religious engage-
ment of tho Roman peoplc: sor au cath had been administered,
which those who had taken it could not set aside with a sase con·
sciense. So Dionysius relates the rule established by L. iunius Bru-
tus. And hence this law was called sacrata And therefore good
men condemned the act of Tiberius Gracchus, when he abrogated the
tribuucship of Octavium and said that the tribunitian power has its
sacrednese from the people, not against the people. And therefore,
