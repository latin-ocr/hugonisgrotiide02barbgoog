· XXIX. 1 Quaeri et hoe solet, an pretinm conventum et
aute mortem non solutum ab herede debeatur. Expedita
mihi videtur responsio, siin earcere mortuus estnon deberi:
promisso enirn inerat conditio, si liberaretur: mortuus autem
uon liberatur. Contra, si mortuus est oum in libertate esset,
deberi. Jam euim lucratus erat id, pro quo promissum erat
pretium.

2 Plane fateor et aliter conveniri posse, ιιι ab ipso con-
tractus momento pure debeatur pretium, et captivus tantum
retineatur, non jam ut jure belli captus, sed ut ase oppigno-
ratus: et contra pactum iniri posse, at procedat pretii solutio,
si die prestituto, qui ceptus sit, liber vivat. Sed haee ut
minus naturalia non presumuntur aeta, nisi manifestis docu-
mentis.

XXX. Proponitur et illud, an in carcerem redire debeat,
qui dimissus est sub pacto, ut faceret dimitti alterum, qui

factum morte praevenerit. Diximus alibi, factum tertii libe· 2¹³2&qu

naliter promissum satis impleri, si nihil omittitur ex parte gagf‘ffi

promissoris; at in onerosis obligari promissorem adid, quod

could not be the possessor of it. From which it follows, that property
so concealed may be applied ιο furnish the amount of ransom; the
ownership having been retained by tho prisoner.

XXIX. 1 This is also a frequent question: whether the ransom
agreed upon, and not paid before death, be due from the heir. The
answer appears ιο me ιο ιο obvious, if the prisoner dio in captivity,
that it is not due: for the promise was, on the condition that the
prisoner should be liberated, and a dead man is not liberated, Οιι
the other hand, if he dies whon he is at liberty, it is due3 for he
had already got the thing for which the price was promised.

2 1 undoubtedly confess that the agreement may ιο made other·
wise,so that, from the moment of the οοιιιιοοι, ιιο price may be abso·
lutoly due, and the prisoner may bo retained, not now aa a prisoner
of war, but as a pledge giren by himself: and on the other hand, that
it may bo serenanted that the payment οι ιιο price shall take place,
if on a certain appointed day, he who is captivabo alive and free.
But such conditione, as being less natural, are netto ιο presumed,
except upon manifest evidence.

XXX. This question also is propoundod: whether he ought ιο
return into captivity, who was set free, on the compaot that he should
cause another to be liberated, who, by dying, presented that being
done. We heve elsewhere said that the liberal promise of a third
person is fullilled with sufficient exactness, if nothing be omitted ou
