Parrhasius emerat Quarit enim eum decretum factum esset
ab Atheniensibus quo Olynthii juberentur liberi esse, hoc 4οοιι-
tineretur liberi ut fierent, an ut liberi judicarentur3 quorum

Vl. 1 Liber autem homo, postquam ad suos rediit, non

se tantum sihi acquirit, sed et res omnes quas habuerat apud
populos pacatos, eive corporales, sive incorporales. Quia po·
puli pacati, sieut factum pro jure ιοοιιιί arentin capto, ita
etin liberato, ut se requos praebeant utrique parti. Ergo
dominium quod habuerat iures ejus is, qui belli jure eum
possidebat, non erat sine omni conditione: cessare enim po-
terat ipso invito, si eaptus qui fuerat ad suos pervenisset
Has ergo res sio ille perdit, quomodo hominem cujus erant

But what is the result if he he sold 1)] the enemy in the usual
way of traffie, and eo come to his own people? 'l'his controversy is
treated 1)] Quintilian, with reference to the Olynthium, whom Parrha-
sius had bought. For a decree haring been made 1)] the Atheniens
that the Olynthisns should be free, he anquiren whether this means
thet they should become free, or should be adjudged to be free: of
which the latter is the more true opinion.

VI. l Moreorer a free mun, after he hes returned to his own
peopIe, acquires, not only himself, but all the property which he had
in s neutral State, both corporeal sud incorporeal. For the neutral
State, es they took the fact for law in the case of eaptivity, must do
the sume in the csse of liberation, to show themselves impartiti to
both parties. Therefore the right, which he who possessed him 1)]
the law of war, had orer his property, was not altogether without oon·
ditione: it was lisble to cesse without his consent, if he who had been
captive made his way to his own people. He therefore loses the pro·
, party, es he loses the man to whom it was an necessary.

2 But what if he had alienated this property? Will he who de·
rires his title hom him who, at the time, was owner, 1)] the right of
war, be aufe 1)] the law of natione ς οι may the property be recovered
