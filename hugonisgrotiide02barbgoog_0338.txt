3 At in regnis patrimonialibus quo minus rex regnum
alienet, nihil impedit. Fieri tamen potest ut talis rex partem
aliquam imperii alienare uon valeat, si nempe regnum sub
onere ejus non dividendi in proprietatem acceperit. Bona

such a case, when civil society was fonned.

3 But iu patrimonial kingdoms, there is nothing which preventa
the king alienating his kingdom. still, it may be, that such a king
has not power to alienate any part of the empire; numely, if he had
received the kingdom aa his property, with the eous of not diriding
it. As to tho raluables which are called the Property of the Orowu,
they may corne into the king's putrimony in two ways; either separa·
·bty, or inseparabty 'with the kingdom itsels. If in the latter mode,
they may be transferred, but only with the kingdom if in the former,
they may be transferred separately.

4 hs to kings whose kingdom is not patrimonial, they cun hardly
hare the right of alienating the property of the crown; except it
