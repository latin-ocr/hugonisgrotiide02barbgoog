deterior fit patrias causa, cui is, qui captus est, ni liberetur,
jam periisse censendus est.

VIII. Promittunt et nonnulli non fugere: tenet hoc eos,
,etiamsi vincti promiserint, contraquam quidam sentiunt. N am
etsie solet autritaserrari, aut mitior obtineri custodia. Si
rere rinctus sit postea, ita demum liber erit, si ideo promi·
serit, ne vinciretur.

IX. Satis inepte quaritur, an, qui captus est, alii dedere
se possit. N imis enim certum est, neminem sua pactione jus
alteri quaesitum adimere posse. Est autem captori jus quas-
situm, aut ipso belli jure, aut partim belli jure, partim con-
cessu ejus qui bellum gerit, secundum ea quas supra expo- {gy-,⁶44
surmus.

X. Circa effectus pactorum egregia quaestio est, an pri·
rati, si infide praestauda negligentes sint, a suis potestatibus
cogendi sint eam implere. Et cogendos verius estin bello
duntaxat solenni, ob jus gentium, quo bellum gerentes obstrin-
guntur alter alteri jus reddere, etiam de sactis privatorum, ut
puta ai a privatis violati essent hostium legati. Sic Cornelius

they promised3 contrary to the opinion of some moralists. For in this
way, mcn's lires are saved, and their captirity mado less harsh. If,
however, a person, haring made such a promise, is afterwards put in
chains, he will be liberatcd from his promise, if he made it to avoid
being put in chains.

IX. A question is raised, idly enough, whether he who is captured
can surrender himself to another than the captor. For it is abund-
antly certain that no one can by a compact of his take away a right
from another. And the captor has already acquited a right, either by
the right ot* war, or partly by the right of war, partly by the conces-
sion of the superlor authority which makes the ποις aa we haro ex-
plained abore.

X. With regard to the effects of compacts, thero is a noted
question, whether private persons, if they are negligent in fultilling
theIr engagements, can be compelled by their own authorities. And
the sounder opinion is, that they are compellabis only in a regular
war, on account of the st of Nations, by thch the belligerante are
bound to fultll the rules of justice to euch other, eren with regard to
the acts of private personsy aa ior instance, if ambassadors had been
