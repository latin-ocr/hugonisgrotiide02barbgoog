nomen etipse, qui damnum passus est, si opus est, contri·
bnet. Neque hoc onere levabitur civitas, si nune forte ei
praestationi par non sit, sed quandocumque copia suppetit,
exseret sese quasi sopita obligatio.

VIII. Neque illud indistincte admitto, quod dicit Fordi-
nandns Vasquius, agnoscere civitatem non debere id damnum, navant

quod jam bello datum est, eo qnod jus belli talia permittat. Ξῖιζΐῗζ

Nam jus illud belli populos alios spectat, ut alibi exposuimus: ψ,
partim et hostes inter se, non cives inter se, qui cum socii
sint aequum est ut communia habeant damna, quac societatis hermem

causa contingunt. Plane civili lege ct hoe constitui poterit, iim&

ut rei bello amissae causa nulla adversus civitatem actio sit,
nt sua quisque acrius defendat.

IX. Sunt qui latum discrimen collocant inter ea, quae
civium sunt ex gentium jure, et eaquae eorundem sunt ex
jure civili, ut in haec jus lanius regi concedant, etiam auferendi
sine causa et compensatione, in illa non item: perverse: nam
dominium ex qualicunque causa ortum sit, suos semper effectus
habet ex ipso jure naturali, ut scilicet auferri nequeat nisi ex

bound to make good the loss ιο those who lose their property; and
ιο ιιιῑι public purpose, among others, he who has suffered the loss
must, if need be, contributa. Nor is the state relieved from this
enac, ιι, for the present, ιι be unable to discharge ιιι but at any futuro
tIme, when the means ere thero, the obligation which had been sus·
pended revives.

vm. Nor do I admit, without distInction, what Vosquius saysr
that tho state is ιιοι bound ιο aeknowledge the damage which is
inflicted by war, because tho right of war permits such damage. For
that right οι war has regard ιο other peoplcs, as wo have elsewhere
explained3 and, partly at least, affecte enemies in their mutual rela·
tions, not citizens in theirs; for since these are socially bound toge-
ther, it is just that they bear ιιι common the losscs wbIch huppen for
the sake of society. It may however be established by the Civil
Low, that a thng lost in war shall not give a citizens right ofrcco·
very against the State3 iu order that each person may themora
strenuously defend his own property.

IX. There are some writers who make a broad distinction be-
tween things which belong to the citIzons by the Law of NatIons, and
things which belong ιο thcm by the Oivil Laws so that with regard ιο
the former, they allow a looeer right ιο the kiug, so that he may take
them without causo and without compensation; bnt not so with regard
to the latter. Wrongly. For ownershIp, from whatever eausa it
