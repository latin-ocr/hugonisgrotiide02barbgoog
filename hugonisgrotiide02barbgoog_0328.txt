XlV. But at ιιι samo time il is to be remarked, that there are
two ways in which the promisee may be blamcless οι perfidy, though
ιι ιιοιι not perform what hc had promised; namely, by defect of ιιι
condition, and by compensation.

By dolect οι condition, the promiser ia not truly liberatcd from a
promise, but the erent shows that thore was no obligation, since it was
contracted only under ιιο condition. And to this head is ιο ιι
referred the case in which the other party has not fulfilted what, on
his part, he was bound to fulfil. For in a contract of that kind, each
article implies the others in ιιι way οι condition ; as ιι ιι ιιι been
expressed by saying,1 will do so and so if the other does what ho has
promised. So Tullus, answering the Albane, says that hc calls tha
gods to witness that, lVlticlreoer people shall first reject aad damae the
omboosodora who come ond acle sor restitutioo, on testati foll att ete
calamitier of tlte acor. Ulpicn says, He ιἰιιοι ιο bo held αι ιιι olly who
renouuced tlte treoty ιιιαιιιι some condition on which tlte ollionce ιιαι
opreed to was not performed. On this account, if the intention οι the
treaty bc different from this, it is usually clearly expressed, that ιι
anything bo dono contrary to this or that part, ιιι other parts still
remain ralid.
