68 DE BELLA JUSTO SIVE SOLENNI JURE [Lus. 111.

praedones, neque in co quod rex gerit in subditos locum
parque habent. Ideo Seneca distinete dixit: indicto bella finitimis,

„wa Xll. Nam quod notant quidam et exemplis docent,
etiam in bellis talibus capta fieri capientium, rerum est, sed
ex una dumtaxat parte, idque ex jure naturali, uon ex jure

voluntario gentium, ut quod gentibus tantum prospicit, aon his

pipam. qui sine gente sunt, aut pars gentis. Errant et in eo, quod
putant bellum sui tuendi aut rerum tuendarum ergo suscep-
tum indictione non egere: narn eget omnino: uon quidem
simpliciter, sed ad eos quos dicere coepimus, et mox explicabi-
mus, effeetus.

XIII. Ne illud quidem verum, non statim atque indie-
tum est inferri bellum posse: quod Cyrus in Armenios, Ro-
mani in Carthaginienses, ut modo diximus, fecerunt. Nam
indictio nullum post se tempus jure gentium requirit. Potest
mmen fieri, ut ex naturali jure tempus aliquod requiratur ex
negotii qualitate, puta eum res repetitae sunt, aut poena in
nocentem postulata, et id negatum non est. Tune enim id

XII. For what some remark aad illustrate by examples, that
eren in such uara, what is captured becomes the property of the cap·
tora is true, but on one side only, and that by Natural Lau, not by
the instituted Las of Nations; since that regards only nations and
their dealings with nations, not those who are without nation, or are
only part of a nation. They err in this, that thoy think that a war
undertaken for the purpose of defending one’s aelf or one's property,
does not need to be preceded by a declaration ef war3 for it by
all means necds such an introduct-ion: not indeed simply, but for
tho sake of leading to the effecta we have already partly explained, and
shall explain further.

XIII. Nor is it true cren that a war may net be begua immedi-
ately after it has been declared: which Cyrus did in Armenia, and
the Romans torvards tbe Carthaginiaus, as we hare already said. For
a declaration of war does not, by the Law ot Nations, require any
delinito time after it. But it may be requisita that, by Natural
Law, some rime may bo required, in consequence of the quality of
the business: as for instance, if property is required to be restored,
