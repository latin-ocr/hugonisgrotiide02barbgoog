XXVI. Et potest idem pluribus debere pretium, si ab
uno dimissus, pretio nondum soluto, captus sit abJalio: suut
enim diversa haec debita ex diversis causis.

XXVII. conventio de pretio facta rescindi non potest,
eo quod captus intelligatur locupletior quam credebatur: quia
jure gentium externo, de quo quaerimus, nemo cogitur sup-
plere quod in contractu minus aequo pretio promisit, si dolus
non intercessit: ut intelhgi potest ex his quae de contractibus

nu. u m supra a nobis explicata sunt
m XXVIII. Ex eo, quod diximus captivos nostros servos

non esse, sequitur cessare illam acquisitionem universalem,
ppos:- quam accessionem esse dominii in personam diximus alibi.
N on alia ergo captori acquirentur quam quae specialiter appre-
henderit: quare siquid clam secum habet captivus, non erit
acquisitum, quia nec possessum. Sicut Paulus jurisconsultus

ausura contra Brutum et Manilium respondit, qui fundum possessione

himerici cepit, thesaurum, quem in fundo esse nesciat, non cepisse:

Μ quia qui nescit nequeat possidere. Cui consequens est, ut res
eo modo celata ad redemtionis pretium solvendum prodesse
possit, quasi retento dominio.

XXVI. And the same person may owe the amount of ransom
to more persons than one, if, when he has been let go by oue, and
tho price is not yet pald, ho is captured by another: for thcse aro
different debts from different causes.

XXVII. The agreement concernIng the amount of ransom, cau·
not be rescinded on account oi the prisoner belng discovered to be
richer thau he was supposed to be: because, by the external Law of
Nations, which is the subJ‘oct of our present enquiry, no ono is com·
pelled to gite more thau ho promised ln a contract, at a price different
from the current price, il there has been no deceit: as may be under
stood from what we hare said about Contracta

XXVIII. From wh'at we have said, that prisoners with us aro not
slaves, it follows that there is an end of that acquisition of a rIght
over all that belongs to tho person, as well aa the person: sor that this
is a mere accessory to the power orer the person, we have elsewhere
said. Thorel'ore nothIng else becomes the property of the captor,
but what ho specially takes possession of. And therefore, ii Ibe
prisoner has anything secretcd with him, that is not acquired by the
captor, because it was never in his possession. So Paulus the jurist
gare his opinIon against Brutus and Manilius, thet ho who came iuto
possession of a picco ol land, didjnot acquire possession of atreasuro
thch ho dId not know to be there: because not knowIng ol it, he
