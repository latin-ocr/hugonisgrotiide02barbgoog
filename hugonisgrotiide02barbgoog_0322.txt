Car. XIX.] DE FIDE INTER HOSTES. 809

Vl. Quid dicemus de subditorum bellis adversus reges

aliasque summas potestates? his, etiamsi causam per se non
injustam habeant, jus tamen per vim agendi deesse ostendimus
alibi. Potest interdum et tanta esse aut causae injustitia, aut ursas.
resistendi improbitas, ut puniri graviter possit. Tamensi
quasi cum desertoribus aut rebellibus actum sit, poena pro-
misso opponi non potest, secundum ea quae modo diximus. -
Nam et servis iidem servandam veterum pietas existimavit,

credito Lacedaemonios iram divinam expertos, quod Taenaren- ffpgpffiar·

ses servos contra pacta occidissent. Et Diodorus Siculus no· Uesti
tat iidem servis datam in feno Palicorum nunquam a quc·

quam domino fuisse violatam. Metus autem illati exceptio et

hic poterit elidi interposito jurejurando, sicut tM. Pomponius
tribunusplebis jurejurando obstrictus servavit, quod L. Manlio

metu coactus promiserat.

Vll. Sed hic supra priores specialem difficultatem iacit
jus legis constituendae et jus supereminens dominii in res sub-
ditorum quod civitati competit, et ejus nomine a summam po-

Jarcoit tribuam necsesellit, et sauram diuam redigere. Seneca de Beneficiis

natione have agreed ιο overloolr what is donc against them, even by
vicinus acts.

VI. What shall wo say oi the wars of subjecta against kings and
other supreme authorities? That these, even when they have a cause
iu itscli not unjust‚ still have not the right ci aeting by force, wc have
shown elsewhere. But sometimes, in such cases, the injustioe ci the
cause, or the wickedness of the resistance‚ may be so great, that it may
be liable to heavy punishment. And yet ii a treaty be conducted with
persons, as with desertore or robbers, such liability cannot bc opposed
to the promise, as we have just said. Even ιο slaves, saith must be
lrept, according to the piety oi tho ancients3 and it was believed that
the Laccdremonians were visited by the divine anger, because, con·
trary to convention, they had put ιο death the Taenarians, who were
slavos. And it is noted by Diodorus, that saith pledgcd to a slave in
the temple ci the Palici was never violatcd by a master. And the
exception oi fear imposed, may herc also bc cancelled by interposing
an oath; as M. Pomponius, tribuno of tho people, under the obligation
oi an cath, kept tho promise which 1.. Manlius had made under sear.

the right which the State possessas to make lsws, aud from its right ot
